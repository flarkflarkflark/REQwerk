<h1>Introducing RECwerk</h1>
<p><strong>RECwerk</strong> is a powerful native desktop application designed for professional audio and waveform editing. It provides a fast, responsive interface inspired by classic Digital Audio Workstations like Syntrillium Cool Edit Pro.</p>

<p>This project is a native evolution of the brilliant <strong>AudioMass</strong> engine, originally created by <a href="https://github.com/pkalogiros" target="_blank">Pantelis Kalogiros</a>. While the core engine remains a testament to his web-audio expertise, RECwerk has been modernized and "wrapped" for Linux, Windows, and Mac to provide low-latency audio support and deeper hardware integration.</p>

<h5>:: Native Feature List ::</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>Native Audio Engine</strong>: High-performance stereo and mono support.</li>
<li><strong>Real-time Monitoring</strong>: Hear your input during recording with up to 200% volume boost.</li>
<li><strong>Hardware Selection</strong>: Choose specific Input/Output devices for complex multi-card setups.</li>
<li><strong>Multiformat support</strong>: Native handling of WAV, MP3, OGG, FLAC, and AIFF.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced DSP</strong>: Real-time preview for AI Noise Reduction, Paragraphic EQ, Compression, and Reverb.</li>
<li><strong>Syntrillium Aesthetic</strong>: A classic "Cooler" look-and-feel for the modern era.</li>
<li><strong>Non-destructive editing</strong>: Full undo/redo history for all operations.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>To get started, simply drag and drop an audio file into the workspace. Once the file is loaded, you can view the waveform, zoom in, pan around, and select regions for editing.</p>

<h3>Recording Audio</h3>
<p>To record audio, press the <strong>Recording button</strong> or use the <strong>[R]</strong> key. You can adjust your recording settings (channels, sample rate, monitoring) in the recording modal.</p>

<h3>The Story & Credits</h3>
<p>The soul of RECwerk lies in the <strong>AudioMass</strong> project, written by Pantelis Kalogiros in 2018. He shared it as an open-source tool to show how far web-audio technologies could go without complex frameworks. His philosophy was simple: "be fast and get the job done."</p>

<p>The <strong>flarkAUDIO</strong> team recognized the potential of this engine and decided to take it "out of the browser tab" and onto the desktop. By implementing native wrappers, improving recording capabilities (Stereo/Monitoring), and skinning it with the classic Syntrillium vibe, <strong>RECwerk</strong> was born—honoring its web-based roots while delivering a true desktop DAW experience.</p>

<h3>Performance Considerations (The Technical Rant)</h3>
<p>Working with the Web Audio API in a native context brings its own challenges. As the original author noted, iterating over multiple long arrays can eventually trigger garbage collection, leading to "crackling."</p>

<p>In RECwerk, we address this by moving heavy operations—such as filter processing—to background threads (Web Workers). We are also working towards a pure WASM implementation for signal modification to outperform traditional JS processing, ensuring that even large audio files can be handled without freezing the UI.</p>

<p><em>RECwerk is a free, open-source project. We stand on the shoulders of giants.</em></p>
